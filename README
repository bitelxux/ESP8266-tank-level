New version of https://github.com/bitelxux/levelsensor

Based in a ESP8266 reading from the sensor and uploading to the server.

It supports connection outages by storing values locally with a timestamp
and sending them once the connection is resumed.

HEADS UP!: Server part is WIP. current server.py and server2.py are still
those from the original project.
