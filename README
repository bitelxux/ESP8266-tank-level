New version of https://github.com/bitelxux/levelsensor

Based in a ESP8266 reading from the sensor and uploading to a server
where very likely Grafana will show a nice chart.

It supports connection outages by storing values locally with a timestamp
and sending them once the connection is resumed.

This version will have a lot of improvements like smart use of EEPROM
to store readings when connection to the server is not available,
WiFiManager to dynamically manage connections from any browser,
commands inyection from the server to force actions to happen in the
ESP like EEPROM reset of forget WiFis and much more.

It's a Work in Progress !! Far from being finished !

Also the servers (tank level server and logs server) are not finished.

Link 'cnn' library to arduino's libraries directory
That 'cnn' library will be split from the main code at some point.
And it needs a proper name !

Keep syntonized if you want to see where this ends
